# WIRELESS-NETWORK-PROPOSAL
The main aim of this project is to design a network setup which meets the requirements of a university allowing effective exchange of information between the various  departments.
The task is to create a wireless network proposal has to be prepared for setting up a 
wireless VLAN based infrastructure at a campus. The campus has 3 departments, 
management, research and finance.
Each department has approximately 30 users. ADSL internet connection is available in 
the campus, which needs to be shared by the all the users in the different departments. 
Wireless access to the network should be available using access points installed at 
strategic locations.
Users should also be able to access the network through computers using LAN 
connectivity. Files servers should be setup on the network for users in the departments to 
share and transfer files. Guest users should be able to connect to the internet through the 
wireless access points, without any authentication. Users in each department should have 
a common password, which should be used for gaining access to the network through the 
wireless access points. The guest users should not have access to the file server installed 
on the network. Dynamic IP addressing system should be available from a single DHCP 
server to allocate IP address to all departments users and guests. Users should be able to 
connect to the appropriate departments, highlighted through appropriate names on the 
access point. Appropriate equipment for internet sharing should be made available.
